## Overview
The goal of this challange is to add dark mode functionality to a single page application, it is intended to help us better understand your approach to solving problems using React and JavaScript.

## Requirements
- Add dark-mode switching functionality to the existing sun/moon (dark-mode) button.
  - Utilise the existing dark-mode scss file by adding a `dark-mode` class to the `html` element.
- When in Dark mode:
  - The button icon should be `faSun`.
  - The button icon colour should be `(#FFA500)`. You can use the `color` prop on the `Icon` component.

## Bonus Objectives
- How could we would use dark mode on other potential routes/components in a bigger application. Would your solution work for this?
- How we can apply a class to the `html` DOM element.

## Dependancies
The only dependency for this challenge is NodeJS/NPM. Aside from your editor of choice, you should not need any additional software to complete this challenge.
